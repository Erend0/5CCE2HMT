# 5CCE2HMT
MATLAB script to calculate heat transfer coefficients ( h h) for thermocouples T8 and T9 using Whitaker's correlation. Compares measured vs. expected  h h for "no shield" case ( U > 0 U>0), with air property interpolation. Handles 1 mm (T8) and 3 mm (T9) diameters. Outputs  h h values and percentage differences.
